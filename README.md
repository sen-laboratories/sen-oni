# About

The aim is to provide a foundation of essential types to work with, so not every user has to start from scratch.
The structure follows a common schema so it can be easily consumed and understood.

Additionally, helpers for relation extraction and navigation, as well as entity and structure extraction may be provided.

Where possible, existing ontologies from schema.org, wikidata and similar should be used as a starting point.
However, they are often too complex and do not always define relations, or use properties instead.

Lastly, also existing definitions from ONI should be reused where possible, and only referenced to indicate dependencies.

Still under development but getting there.
